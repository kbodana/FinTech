## My Background

I'm a UW Business school grad. After school, I actually got into technology and then information security. I've worked mostly in the financial services space, however, I currently work for a video game company.

## Career Goals

My long-term goal is to get out of the 9-5 routine and trade markets full time.

## FinTech Career Path

I'm actually not planning on pursuing a career in FinTech. I would like to trade independently full time and would like to be able to analyze data sets of financial data and automate my trading as much as possible.
