# FinTech

Who are you? What is your background?

I'm a UW Business school grad. After school, I actually got into technology and then information security. I've worked mostly in the financial services space, however, I currently work for a video game company.

What are your career goals?

My long-term goal is to get out of the 9-5 routine and trade markets full time.

Why did you choose FinTech as a career path?

I'm actually not planning on pursuing a career in FinTech. I would like to trade independently full time and would like to be able to analyze data sets of financial data and automate my trading as much as possible.
