## My Background

I'm a UW Business school grad. After school, I actually got into technology and then information security. I've worked mostly in the financial services space.

## Career Goals

Win the lottery and retire.

## FinTech Career Path

I'm actually not planning on pursuing a career in FinTech. I was drawn to this program because of the emphasis on using Python and machine learning to analyze large data sets.
